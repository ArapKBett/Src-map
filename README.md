Install package:

`npm install source-map`

Create `pg-filecommenter-sourcemap.js` as above.

Modify `db.js` to import and patch your Pool using `patchPGPoolAsync()`.

Make sure the compiled `.js` files have `.map` files next to them generated by your build tools (`tsc --sourceMap, webpack, or similar`).

Run your app and execute queries. The appended SQL comments will include the original source file and position eg:

`SELECT NOW() /* file=src/example-query.ts:15:10 */;`

This implementation assumes source maps are external `.map` files named `{filename}.map`.

If you want to support `pg.Client` as well, patch it similarly.
